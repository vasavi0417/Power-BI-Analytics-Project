NSF Insights
Non-Sufficient Funds (NSF) report is a critical tool for monitoring payment failures due to insufficient funds. This report helps track bounced checks and failed transactions, enabling the agency to quickly identify delinquent accounts and take timely corrective actions. By analyzing the frequency and patterns of NSF occurrences, the agency can assess risk factors, implement better credit control strategies, and improve recovery rates.
Purpose of the Non-Sufficient Funds (NSF) Dashboard

The NSF dashboard was developed to provide detailed insights into instances of payment failures due to non-sufficient funds, offering visibility into key patterns and trends. Its purpose includes:

Track Payment Failures: Monitor and analyze failed transactions due to non-sufficient funds across various departments and clients.
Identify High-Risk Accounts: Highlight departments and individuals responsible for significant amounts of NSF collections, helping to prioritize recovery efforts and manage high-risk accounts more proactively.
Correction Tracking: Track and display corrections made after NSF occurrences, including whether the outstanding amounts are closed in a single payment or negotiated (e.g., waiving interest). This feature provides insights into how quickly and effectively debts are being resolved.
Optimize Collection Strategies: By showcasing detailed corrections and the nature of payments, the dashboard supports more efficient recovery strategies and better negotiations with clients.
Support Communication and Risk Management: Provide timely insights that help the company initiate early communication with clients regarding payment issues and ensure the appropriate follow-up measures are taken.
